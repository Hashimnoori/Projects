// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Print "Enter the first number: "
Input (int) = num1

Print "Enter the second number: "
Input(int) = num2
Sum = num1 + num2


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Print "Enter a number: "
Input(int) = num
If (number MOD 2==0) THEN
Print "The number is Even"
Else
Print "The number is odd"
EndIf

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

// Step a: Read in 5 separate numbers
DECLARE numbers AS ARRAY OF 5 FLOAT
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
OUTPUT "Enter number " + i + ":"
INPUT numbers[i]
END FOR

// Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers
DECLARE sum AS FLOAT
sum = 0
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
sum = sum + numbers[i]
END FOR
DECLARE average AS FLOAT
average = sum / 5

// Step c: Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers
DECLARE min AS FLOAT
DECLARE max AS FLOAT
min = numbers[1]
max = numbers[1]
FOR i FROM 2 TO 5 DO
IF numbers[i] < min THEN
min = numbers[i]
END IF
IF numbers[i] > max THEN
max = numbers[i]
END IF
END FOR

// Step d: Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
OUTPUT "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
OUTPUT "The smallest (minimum) number is: " + min
OUTPUT "The largest (maximum) number is: " + max
